# 0x01. Python Async Function

## Description
This project involves learning and implementing asynchronous functions in Python using the `asyncio` module. Asynchronous functions allow developers to write non-blocking, concurrent code that can perform multiple operations concurrently, potentially improving performance and responsiveness of applications.

## Concepts Covered
- Introduction to Asynchronous Programming in Python
- Basics of Asynchronous Functions and Coroutines
- Using the `asyncio` module for Asynchronous Programming
- Writing Asynchronous Functions and Using `await` Keyword

## Files
- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Example of a basic asynchronous function with asyncio syntax.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Example of running multiple coroutines concurrently.
- `3-tasks.py`: Example of using asyncio tasks to run coroutines concurrently.
- `4-tasks.py`: Another example of using asyncio tasks to run coroutines concurrently.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open any of the Python files mentioned above in your preferred code editor to explore the examples of asynchronous functions.
3. Run the Python files using the Python interpreter to see the output.

```bash
python3 0-basic_async_syntax.py
