# 0x02. Python Async Comprehension

## Description
This project involves learning and implementing asynchronous comprehensions in Python, which allow for concise and efficient creation of asynchronous generators using the `async` and `await` keywords. Asynchronous comprehensions are useful for asynchronously iterating over sequences and generating asynchronous data streams.

## Concepts Covered
- Introduction to Asynchronous Comprehensions
- Syntax and Usage of Asynchronous Comprehensions
- Writing Asynchronous Generators and Using `async for` Loop

## Files
- `0-async_generator.py`: Example of an asynchronous generator.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Example of using asynchronous comprehensions.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Example of measuring the runtime of asynchronous comprehensions.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open any of the Python files mentioned above in your preferred code editor to explore the examples of asynchronous comprehensions.
3. Run the Python files using the Python interpreter to see the output.

```bash
python3 0-async_generator.py
